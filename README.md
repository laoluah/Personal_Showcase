# Laolu Awogbade's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio repository! This project contains my personal showcase website and an interactive multi-sport game.

## Contents

This repository contains two main projects:

1. **Portfolio Website** - A personal showcase highlighting my transition from acting/legal background to web development with a focus on voiceover skills
2. **Multi-Sport Arena Game** - An interactive game featuring four different sports built with vanilla JavaScript

## Portfolio Website

My portfolio website features:

- Professional background and skills overview
- Voiceover demo reels with interactive audio player
- Contact information and inquiry form
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Multi-Sport Arena Game

A fun, interactive game featuring four different sports:

- **Football** (Soccer): Kick the ball into the goal for 1 point
- **American Football**: Kick through the field goal posts for 2 points
- **Cricket**: Hit the ball into the stumps for 3 points
- **Basketball**: Score a basket for 4 points

Each player gets 3 turns, for a total of 12 rounds. The player with the highest score at the end wins!

## Technologies Used

Both projects are built using only:
